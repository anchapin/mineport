# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves selectively integrating proven components from ModPorter-AI into the existing mineport architecture to enhance security, analysis capabilities, and conversion quality. The integration focuses on transferring core file processing, Java analysis capabilities, and specialized conversion agents while maintaining mineport's simpler, more maintainable architecture. The goal is to leverage battle-tested components from ModPorter-AI without introducing unnecessary complexity or dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using mineport, I want enhanced file validation and security scanning so that I can safely process uploaded mod files without security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL validate the file against allowed MIME types (application/java-archive, application/zip, application/x-zip-compressed)
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL check the file size against a maximum limit of 500MB
3. WHEN a ZIP file is processed THEN the system SHALL validate the ZIP magic number (0x50, 0x4B, 0x03, 0x04)
4. WHEN processing any archive file THEN the system SHALL scan for ZIP bomb attacks and path traversal vulnerabilities
5. IF a file fails validation THEN the system SHALL return a detailed ValidationResult with specific error information
6. WHEN malware scanning is performed THEN the system SHALL return a ScanResult indicating the safety status of the file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer processing Java mods, I want improved Java analysis capabilities so that I can extract accurate registry names, texture paths, and manifest information from JAR files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a JAR file THEN the system SHALL extract registry names using multiple detection strategies
2. WHEN processing a JAR file THEN the system SHALL detect and catalog texture file paths
3. WHEN parsing a JAR file THEN the system SHALL extract manifest information for mod metadata
4. WHEN registry name extraction fails with one strategy THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative extraction methods
5. IF analysis is successful THEN the system SHALL return an AnalysisResult containing all extracted information
6. WHEN analyzing for MVP purposes THEN the system SHALL focus on essential information needed for basic conversion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the integration to maintain mineport's current architecture simplicity so that the system remains maintainable and doesn't introduce unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating ModPorter-AI components THEN the system SHALL NOT introduce CrewAI dependencies
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL NOT require full Docker orchestration
3. WHEN adding database functionality THEN the system SHALL use mineport's existing approach rather than complex database systems
4. WHEN porting components THEN the system SHALL focus on TypeScript/Node.js equivalents rather than Python-specific libraries
5. IF a component adds significant complexity THEN the system SHALL evaluate simpler alternatives that provide similar functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on mod conversion, I want specialized conversion agents so that I can achieve better conversion quality for different types of mod components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting assets THEN the system SHALL provide an AssetConverter for texture and resource conversion
2. WHEN generating addon structures THEN the system SHALL provide a BedrockArchitect for addon structure generation
3. WHEN creating block and item definitions THEN the system SHALL provide a BlockItemGenerator for definition creation
4. WHEN conversion agents are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with existing mineport patterns
5. IF an agent encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want a comprehensive validation pipeline so that I can ensure conversion quality and catch issues before final output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversion is completed THEN the system SHALL run multi-stage validation checks
2. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL check for structural integrity of generated addons
3. WHEN validating conversions THEN the system SHALL verify that all required components are present
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback about what needs to be corrected
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL mark the conversion as ready for use
6. WHEN implementing validation THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing mineport error handling patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the integration to be implemented in phases so that I can manage risk and ensure each component works properly before adding complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the integration THEN the system SHALL follow a phased approach starting with core file processing
2. WHEN Phase 1 is complete THEN the system SHALL have enhanced file validation and security features working
3. WHEN Phase 2 is complete THEN the system SHALL have improved Java analysis capabilities integrated
4. WHEN Phase 3 is complete THEN the system SHALL have specialized conversion agents implemented
5. WHEN Phase 4 is complete THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive validation system in place
6. IF any phase encounters issues THEN the system SHALL allow rollback without affecting previous phases
