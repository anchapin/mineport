# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing all failing CI checks in PR #4 (feat: Implement Core Job Queue Functionality). The PR introduces comprehensive job queue functionality but has multiple CI failures across different categories: JSDoc documentation issues, TypeScript compilation errors, type mismatches, missing dependencies, and interface inconsistencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: JSDoc Documentation Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all public methods and interfaces to have proper JSDoc documentation, so that the codebase maintains high documentation standards and passes CI validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JSDoc validation runs THEN all public methods SHALL have complete JSDoc comments
2. WHEN a public method has parameters THEN it SHALL include @param tags for each parameter
3. WHEN a public method returns a value THEN it SHALL include @returns tag with description
4. WHEN an interface or class is public THEN it SHALL have a description in its JSDoc comment
5. WHEN JSDoc validation runs THEN there SHALL be zero missing JSDoc errors

### Requirement 2: TypeScript Compilation Success

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript code to compile without errors, so that the build process succeeds and the application can be deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN there SHALL be zero compilation errors
2. WHEN type interfaces are used THEN they SHALL be properly imported and defined
3. WHEN method signatures are called THEN the correct number and types of arguments SHALL be provided
4. WHEN properties are accessed THEN they SHALL exist on the target type
5. WHEN generic types are used THEN they SHALL be properly constrained and typed

### Requirement 3: Interface and Type Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent interfaces and types across the codebase, so that there are no type conflicts or missing properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL not have conflicting exports with the same name
2. WHEN job-related types are used THEN they SHALL include all required properties like retryCount
3. WHEN conversion result types are accessed THEN they SHALL have consistent property names
4. WHEN worker pool configurations are used THEN they SHALL only include valid configuration options
5. WHEN source location types are used THEN they SHALL have consistent property structures

### Requirement 4: Dependency and Import Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dependencies and imports to be properly resolved, so that the application can find all required modules and types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external dependencies are used THEN they SHALL be properly installed and available
2. WHEN internal modules are imported THEN they SHALL export the expected members
3. WHEN type-only imports are needed THEN they SHALL be properly declared
4. WHEN module resolution occurs THEN there SHALL be no missing module errors
5. WHEN circular dependencies exist THEN they SHALL be resolved or restructured

### Requirement 5: Test Compatibility and Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to be compatible with the updated code structure, so that the test suite passes and validates functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL use the correct method signatures and interfaces
2. WHEN mock objects are created THEN they SHALL match the expected interface structure
3. WHEN test data is provided THEN it SHALL conform to the required type definitions
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL properly handle the new job queue functionality
5. WHEN performance tests execute THEN they SHALL use valid configuration options

### Requirement 6: Security and Code Quality Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to pass all security scans and quality checks, so that the application maintains security standards and code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security scans run THEN they SHALL detect no critical vulnerabilities
2. WHEN dependency audits execute THEN they SHALL show no high-severity issues
3. WHEN code quality checks run THEN they SHALL pass all configured rules
4. WHEN secret detection runs THEN it SHALL find no exposed credentials
5. WHEN static analysis executes THEN it SHALL identify no security issues
