# Requirements Document: Consistency Improvements

## Introduction

The Consistency Improvements project aims to address identified inconsistencies and integration issues in the Minecraft Mod Converter codebase. This initiative will enhance the maintainability, reliability, and scalability of the application by standardizing interfaces, improving error handling, connecting UI with backend services, and ensuring proper integration between modules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interface Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized interfaces across the codebase, so that I can easily understand and work with different modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN system SHALL have a centralized location for shared interface definitions
2. WHEN comparing interfaces with the design document THEN system SHALL have interfaces that match the specifications
3. WHEN reviewing interface naming THEN system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions across all modules
4. WHEN adding new interfaces THEN system SHALL enforce the established naming conventions
5. WHEN interfaces need to deviate from design THEN system SHALL include documentation explaining the deviation

### Requirement 2: Unified Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent error handling mechanism across all modules, so that errors can be properly tracked, reported, and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any module THEN system SHALL use a common error reporting structure
2. WHEN errors are collected THEN system SHALL classify them by severity and type
3. WHEN the conversion process completes THEN system SHALL aggregate all errors into a comprehensive report
4. WHEN errors occur THEN system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and potential solutions
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN system SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 3: UI and Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to accurately reflect the actual conversion process, so that I can track progress and understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversion is initiated THEN system SHALL connect UI actions to actual backend services
2. WHEN conversion is in progress THEN system SHALL display accurate progress information matching the actual pipeline stages
3. WHEN errors occur during conversion THEN system SHALL display meaningful error messages in the UI
4. WHEN conversion completes THEN system SHALL update UI state without requiring page refresh
5. WHEN user preferences are set THEN system SHALL apply them to the actual conversion process

### Requirement 4: JobQueue and Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the conversion pipeline to properly utilize the JobQueue service, so that multiple conversion requests can be processed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversion request is received THEN system SHALL create a job in the JobQueue
2. WHEN resources are available THEN system SHALL process jobs according to priority
3. WHEN a job is being processed THEN system SHALL update its status in real-time
4. WHEN a job completes or fails THEN system SHALL properly update its status and release resources
5. WHEN system load is high THEN system SHALL manage resources efficiently across multiple jobs

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a centralized configuration management system, so that application settings can be easily updated without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application starts THEN system SHALL load configuration from a centralized source
2. WHEN configuration values are needed THEN system SHALL use the configuration service instead of hardcoded values
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN system SHALL apply changes without requiring restart
4. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN system SHALL report errors and use safe defaults
5. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN system SHALL load appropriate configuration for the environment

### Requirement 6: Smart Compromise Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want the Smart Compromise Framework to be properly integrated with other modules, so that features that cannot be directly converted are handled intelligently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unmappable code is detected THEN system SHALL select appropriate compromise strategies
2. WHEN user preferences for compromise strategies are set THEN system SHALL apply them during conversion
3. WHEN compromise strategies are applied THEN system SHALL report them in the conversion report
4. WHEN multiple compromise strategies are applicable THEN system SHALL select the most appropriate one
5. WHEN a compromise strategy is ineffective THEN system SHALL provide feedback for improvement

### Requirement 7: Module Structure Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent module structure across the codebase, so that I can easily navigate and understand the application architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining a module THEN system SHALL have a consistent export pattern
2. WHEN modules interact THEN system SHALL have clear dependency documentation
3. WHEN modules are initialized THEN system SHALL follow a consistent initialization pattern
4. WHEN circular dependencies are detected THEN system SHALL report them as errors
5. WHEN new modules are added THEN system SHALL enforce the established structure

### Requirement 8: Testing Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved testing structure and coverage, so that I can be confident in the reliability of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN system SHALL test module interactions rather than individual components
2. WHEN tests run THEN system SHALL validate interface compliance
3. WHEN tests run THEN system SHALL validate error handling consistency
4. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN system SHALL include interface and integration coverage
5. WHEN new code is added THEN system SHALL require tests that maintain or improve coverage

### Requirement 9: API Mapping Dictionary Service

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper API Mapping Dictionary service, so that Java to Bedrock API mappings can be easily updated and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LogicTranslationEngine runs THEN system SHALL use the API Mapping Dictionary service
2. WHEN Minecraft API changes THEN system SHALL support updating mappings without code changes
3. WHEN mappings are updated THEN system SHALL validate them for correctness
4. WHEN mappings are missing THEN system SHALL provide meaningful feedback
5. WHEN mappings are frequently used THEN system SHALL cache them for performance

### Requirement 10: Documentation Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized documentation across the codebase, so that I can easily understand the purpose and usage of different components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining code THEN system SHALL have consistent JSDoc comments for all public APIs
2. WHEN reviewing architecture THEN system SHALL have clear documentation of module interactions
3. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN system SHALL provide comprehensive setup and contribution guides
4. WHEN architectural decisions are made THEN system SHALL document the rationale
5. WHEN documentation is updated THEN system SHALL ensure it remains consistent with the code
