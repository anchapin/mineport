# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Core Functionality Implementation project addresses the critical gaps remaining after the ModPorter-AI integration to deliver a fully functional, production-ready Minecraft mod conversion system. This initiative focuses on connecting the enhanced backend capabilities to the user interface, implementing the core logic translation engine, building intelligent compromise strategies, and completing the end-to-end conversion pipeline. The goal is to transform the enhanced processing capabilities into a complete user-facing system that can successfully convert Java mods to Bedrock addons.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: UI and Backend Service Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to utilize the enhanced backend services from ModPorter-AI integration, so that I can benefit from improved security scanning, multi-strategy analysis, and specialized conversion agents through an intuitive interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file through the UI THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced FileProcessor with security scanning capabilities
2. WHEN conversion progress is displayed THEN the system SHALL show real-time updates from the enhanced ValidationPipeline stages
3. WHEN analysis results are presented THEN the system SHALL display information from the multi-strategy JavaAnalyzer
4. WHEN conversion errors occur THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information from the EnhancedErrorCollector
5. WHEN users configure conversion options THEN the system SHALL apply settings to the specialized conversion agents
6. WHEN conversion completes THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive results from all integrated components

### Requirement 2: Core Logic Translation Engine

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want my Java mod code to be intelligently converted to JavaScript for Bedrock's Scripting API, so that the addon preserves the original mod's functionality and behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Java code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL parse it into a Minecraft Modding Intermediate Representation (MMIR)
2. WHEN code patterns are directly mappable THEN the system SHALL use AST-based transpilation for accurate conversion
3. WHEN complex or unmappable code is encountered THEN the system SHALL use LLM-based semantic translation
4. WHEN LLM generates code THEN the system SHALL validate functional equivalence using Program State Alignment
5. WHEN validation detects logical divergence THEN the system SHALL iteratively refine the translation until consistency is achieved
6. WHEN translation completes THEN the system SHALL integrate AST and LLM outputs into cohesive JavaScript files

### Requirement 3: Smart Compromise Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want the system to intelligently handle features that cannot be directly converted, so that the resulting addon remains functional and preserves the core mod experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unmappable code is detected THEN the system SHALL select appropriate compromise strategies based on feature type
2. WHEN custom dimensions are detected THEN the system SHALL implement teleportation-based simulation strategies
3. WHEN advanced rendering code is detected THEN the system SHALL create stub implementations with clear documentation
4. WHEN complex UI/HUD elements are detected THEN the system SHALL map logical flow to available Bedrock form types
5. WHEN compromise strategies are applied THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports of all compromises made
6. WHEN multiple compromise options exist THEN the system SHALL select the most appropriate strategy based on user preferences

### Requirement 4: JobQueue and Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the conversion pipeline to efficiently manage multiple concurrent conversion requests, so that the system can scale to handle production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversion request is received THEN the system SHALL create a job in the JobQueue with appropriate priority
2. WHEN resources are available THEN the system SHALL process jobs according to priority and resource constraints
3. WHEN a job is being processed THEN the system SHALL update its status in real-time and provide progress information
4. WHEN a job completes or fails THEN the system SHALL properly update its status and release allocated resources
5. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently across multiple concurrent jobs
6. WHEN jobs are queued THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion times and queue position information

### Requirement 5: API Mapping Dictionary Service

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive API mapping service that translates Java mod APIs to Bedrock equivalents, so that the logic translation engine can produce accurate and functional JavaScript code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LogicTranslationEngine processes Java API calls THEN the system SHALL use the API Mapping Dictionary service for translation
2. WHEN Minecraft API versions change THEN the system SHALL support updating mappings without code changes
3. WHEN mappings are updated THEN the system SHALL validate them for correctness and completeness
4. WHEN mappings are missing THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful feedback and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN frequently used mappings are accessed THEN the system SHALL cache them for improved performance
6. WHEN custom mappings are needed THEN the system SHALL support user-defined mapping extensions

### Requirement 6: Centralized Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a centralized configuration system that manages all ModPorter-AI components and conversion settings, so that the system can be easily configured and maintained across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from a centralized ConfigurationService
2. WHEN configuration values are needed THEN the system SHALL use the configuration service instead of hardcoded values
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring application restart
4. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL report errors and use safe defaults
5. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN the system SHALL load appropriate configuration for the deployment environment
6. WHEN feature flags are toggled THEN the system SHALL enable or disable functionality dynamically

### Requirement 7: Complete Asset Translation Pipeline

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want all visual and auditory assets from my Java mod to be correctly converted to Bedrock format, so that the addon maintains the original aesthetic and sensory experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN texture files are processed THEN the system SHALL convert them to Bedrock format while maintaining visual fidelity
2. WHEN Java block/item models are detected THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding Bedrock geometry files
3. WHEN sound files are present THEN the system SHALL convert them to Bedrock-compatible formats and generate sounds.json
4. WHEN particle effects are found THEN the system SHALL map them to the closest available Bedrock particle types
5. WHEN assets are converted THEN the system SHALL organize them according to Bedrock Resource Pack structure
6. WHEN asset conversion completes THEN the system SHALL validate all assets for Bedrock compatibility

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Metadata Translation

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want all static configuration and metadata from my Java mod to be correctly mapped to Bedrock format, so that items, blocks, and other components are properly registered and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mod metadata is extracted THEN the system SHALL generate valid Bedrock manifest.json files with appropriate UUIDs
2. WHEN Java mod registers blocks and items THEN the system SHALL convert them to Bedrock's JSON definition format

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in any component THEN the system SHALL use a unified error reporting structure with detailed context
2. WHEN component integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error information and recovery suggestions
3. WHEN the system runs integration tests THEN it SHALL validate interactions between all major components
4. WHEN error patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL aggregate and categorize them for analysis
