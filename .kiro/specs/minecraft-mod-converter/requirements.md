# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Minecraft Mod Converter is a hybrid translation pipeline designed to convert Minecraft Java Edition mods to Bedrock Edition addons. This application bridges the gap between Java and Bedrock modding ecosystems by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based code transpilation with Large Language Model (LLM) semantic reasoning. The system acknowledges the fundamental architectural differences between the platforms and employs a "Smart Compromise" framework to handle features that cannot be directly translated while preserving the original mod's core functionality and experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mod Ingestion and Analysis

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want to upload a Java mod (.jar file) and optionally link to its source code repository, so that the system can analyze its compatibility with Bedrock.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user uploads a .jar file THEN system SHALL accept and validate it as a valid Minecraft Java mod
2. WHEN user provides an optional GitHub repository link THEN system SHALL use it to access unobfuscated source code
3. WHEN a mod is uploaded THEN system SHALL identify the mod loader type (Forge or Fabric)
4. WHEN analysis begins THEN system SHALL categorize mod features into four tiers of conversion feasibility (Fully Translatable, Approximation Possible, Natively Impossible, Unanalyzable)
5. WHEN analysis completes THEN system SHALL present a detailed compatibility report to the user
6. WHEN a mod contains a LICENSE file THEN system SHALL parse and enforce its terms during conversion

### Requirement 2: Asset Translation

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want all visual and auditory assets from my Java mod to be correctly converted to Bedrock format, so that the addon maintains the original aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion runs THEN system SHALL convert texture files while maintaining their visual appearance
2. WHEN Java block/item models are detected THEN system SHALL generate corresponding Bedrock model files
3. WHEN sound files are present THEN system SHALL convert them to Bedrock-compatible formats and generate appropriate sounds.json
4. WHEN the mod contains custom particle effects THEN system SHALL map them to the closest available Bedrock particles
5. WHEN conversion completes THEN system SHALL organize all assets according to Bedrock Resource Pack structure

### Requirement 3: Configuration and Metadata Translation

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want all static configuration and metadata from my Java mod to be correctly mapped to Bedrock format, so that items, blocks, and other components are properly registered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion runs THEN system SHALL extract mod ID, version, name, and description from Java manifest files
2. WHEN extraction completes THEN system SHALL generate valid Bedrock manifest.json files with appropriate UUIDs
3. WHEN Java mod registers blocks and items programmatically THEN system SHALL convert them to Bedrock's JSON format
4. WHEN Java mod contains crafting recipes and loot tables THEN system SHALL convert them to Bedrock schema
5. WHEN conversion completes THEN system SHALL embed original license and attribution information in the output .mcaddon file

### Requirement 4: Logic Translation Engine

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want my Java mod's code to be intelligently converted to JavaScript for Bedrock's Scripting API, so that the addon preserves as much of the original functionality as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion runs THEN system SHALL parse Java code into a Minecraft Modding Intermediate Representation (MMIR)
2. WHEN code is in MMIR format THEN system SHALL use AST-based transpilation for directly mappable code patterns
3. WHEN the system encounters complex or unmappable code THEN system SHALL use LLM-based semantic translation
4. WHEN LLM generates code THEN system SHALL validate its functional equivalence using Program State Alignment
5. WHEN validation detects logical divergence THEN system SHALL iteratively refine the translation until consistency is achieved
6. WHEN translation completes THEN system SHALL integrate AST and LLM outputs into cohesive JavaScript files

### Requirement 5: Smart Compromise Framework

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want the system to intelligently handle features that cannot be directly converted, so that the resulting addon remains functional and preserves the core experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system identifies Tier 3 (Natively Impossible) features THEN system SHALL implement appropriate compromise strategies
2. WHEN custom dimensions are detected THEN system SHALL simulate them using teleportation and visual effects
3. WHEN advanced rendering code is detected THEN system SHALL stub it out and provide recommendations for alternatives
4. WHEN complex UI/HUD elements are detected THEN system SHALL map their logical flow to available Bedrock form types
5. WHEN any feature is stubbed out THEN system SHALL insert well-commented code that logs warnings to the console
6. WHEN conversion completes THEN system SHALL generate a detailed report of all compromises made

### Requirement 6: Packaging and Output

**User Story:** As a mod developer, I want the system to package the converted components into a valid Bedrock addon, so that it can be easily installed and used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation completes THEN system SHALL assemble all components into a valid .mcaddon package
2. WHEN packaging completes THEN system SHALL generate a comprehensive conversion report
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN system SHALL include clear instructions for any manual post-processing needed
4. WHEN the addon is packaged THEN system SHALL validate it against Bedrock addon specifications
5. WHEN validation passes THEN system SHALL make the addon available for download

### Requirement 7: System Architecture and Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the conversion pipeline to be modular, scalable, and efficient, so that it can handle a wide range of mods with reasonable performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN multiple conversion requests are received THEN system SHALL process them in parallel where possible
3. WHEN the Bedrock API is updated THEN system SHALL support a mechanism for updating its internal mapping dictionary
4. WHEN processing large mods THEN system SHALL maintain reasonable performance and resource usage
5. WHEN errors occur THEN system SHALL fail gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
