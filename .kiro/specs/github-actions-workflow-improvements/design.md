# Design Document

## Overview

The enhanced GitHub Actions workflow system will provide a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that modernizes the current basic workflow with advanced features including parallel testing, security scanning, automated deployments, intelligent caching, and comprehensive monitoring. The design leverages existing deployment infrastructure while adding sophisticated automation, security, and observability capabilities.

The system will implement a multi-stage pipeline with clear separation of concerns: continuous integration (CI) for code quality and testing, continuous deployment (CD) for automated releases, and continuous monitoring for operational excellence. The workflow will integrate seamlessly with the existing ModPorter-AI deployment scripts and infrastructure.

## Architecture

### Workflow Structure

The enhanced GitHub Actions workflow will be organized into multiple workflow files, each with specific responsibilities:

1. **Main CI Workflow** (`ci.yml`) - Core continuous integration pipeline
2. **Security Workflow** (`security.yml`) - Dedicated security scanning and compliance
3. **Deployment Workflow** (`deploy.yml`) - Environment-specific deployment automation
4. **Dependency Management** (`dependencies.yml`) - Automated dependency updates
5. **Performance Monitoring** (`performance.yml`) - Performance regression testing
6. **Release Management** (`release.yml`) - Automated release creation and artifact management

### Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline will consist of the following stages:

```

### Matrix Build Strategy

The workflow will implement a comprehensive matrix build strategy to ensure compatibility across different environments:

- **Node.js Versions**: 18.x (LTS), 20.x (LTS), 22.x (Current)
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13, Windows 2022
- **Test Suites**: Unit, Integration, Security, Performance
- **Build Configurations**: Development, Production, Debug

### Caching Strategy

Intelligent caching will be implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Dependency Caching**: Cache `node_modules` based on `package-lock.json` hash
2. **Build Caching**: Cache TypeScript compilation outputs
3. **Test Caching**: Cache test results for unchanged files
4. **Docker Layer Caching**: Cache container layers for deployment
5. **Artifact Caching**: Cache build artifacts between stages

## Error Handling

### Failure Scenarios and Recovery

#### 1. Test Failures
- **Unit Test Failures**: Block PR merge, provide detailed failure reports
- **Integration Test Failures**: Block deployment, trigger investigation workflow
- **Performance Test Failures**: Create warnings, allow manual override for non-critical changes
- **Security Test Failures**: Block deployment, require security team approval

#### 2. Build Failures
- **Compilation Errors**: Immediate failure with detailed error logs
- **Dependency Issues**: Automatic retry with cache invalidation
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Scale up runners or queue for retry

#### 3. Deployment Failures
- **Health Check Failures**: Automatic rollback to previous version
- **Canary Deployment Issues**: Gradual rollback with monitoring
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Retry with exponential backoff, escalate to operations

#### 4. Security Scan Failures
- **High/Critical Vulnerabilities**: Block deployment, create security issues
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Automatic PR creation for updates
- **Secret Detection**: Immediate notification, block deployment

### Retry and Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Automatic Retries**: Transient failures retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. **Manual Retries**: Failed workflows can be manually re-triggered
3. **Partial Retries**: Individual jobs can be retried without re-running entire workflow
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Automated rollback for deployment failures
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures in dependent systems

## Testing Strategy

#### 5. End-to-End Testing
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows and system integration
- **Tools**: Existing E2E test infrastructure
- **Environment**: Production-like staging environment
- **Scenarios**: Critical user paths and edge cases

### Test Data Management

1. **Test Fixtures**: Version-controlled test data and mock objects
2. **Generated Data**: Dynamic test data generation for comprehensive coverage
3. **Environment Isolation**: Separate test databases and services
4. **Data Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of test data after execution
5. **Seed Data**: Consistent seed data for reproducible tests

### Quality Gates

Quality gates will be enforced at multiple stages:

1. **Code Quality Gate**: Linting, formatting, type checking
2. **Test Quality Gate**: Minimum test coverage and pass rates
3. **Security Quality Gate**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
4. **Performance Quality Gate**: Performance budgets and regression limits
5. **Deployment Quality Gate**: Health checks and smoke tests
