# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to modernize and enhance the GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for the ModPorter-AI project. The current workflow is basic and lacks the sophisticated automation, security, and deployment capabilities needed for a production-ready application. The enhanced workflow will provide comprehensive testing, security scanning, performance monitoring, automated deployments with rollback capabilities, and integration with the existing deployment infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive CI pipeline that runs all test suites in parallel, so that I can get fast feedback on code changes and ensure quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL run unit, integration, security, and performance tests in parallel
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate and upload coverage reports with at least 80% coverage threshold
3. WHEN any required test fails THEN the system SHALL block the pull request from being merged
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow the pull request to be merged
5. IF performance tests fail THEN the system SHALL create a warning but not block the merge

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want automated security scanning in the CI pipeline, so that vulnerabilities are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL run dependency vulnerability scanning
2. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL run static code analysis for security issues
3. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL scan for secrets and sensitive information
4. WHEN high-severity vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL block deployment
5. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL upload results to security dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment workflows with environment promotion, so that releases can be deployed safely and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to main THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
2. WHEN staging deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL run smoke tests
3. WHEN smoke tests pass THEN the system SHALL create a production deployment candidate
4. WHEN production deployment is approved THEN the system SHALL deploy using canary strategy
5. WHEN canary deployment fails health checks THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want matrix builds across multiple Node.js versions and operating systems, so that compatibility is ensured across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI runs THEN the system SHALL test against Node.js versions 18.x, 20.x, and 22.x
2. WHEN CI runs THEN the system SHALL test on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
3. WHEN any matrix combination fails THEN the system SHALL report which specific environment failed
4. WHEN all matrix builds pass THEN the system SHALL proceed to deployment stage
5. IF optional matrix combinations fail THEN the system SHALL create warnings but not block

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated dependency updates and security patches, so that the project stays current and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies have updates THEN the system SHALL create automated pull requests
2. WHEN security patches are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize and auto-merge low-risk updates
3. WHEN major version updates are available THEN the system SHALL create pull requests with detailed change logs
4. WHEN dependency updates are merged THEN the system SHALL run full test suite
5. WHEN dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL create issues with resolution guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent caching and optimization, so that CI builds are fast and cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI runs THEN the system SHALL cache node_modules based on package-lock.json hash
2. WHEN CI runs THEN the system SHALL cache build artifacts and reuse when possible
3. WHEN cache hits occur THEN the system SHALL reduce build time by at least 50%
4. WHEN cache misses occur THEN the system SHALL rebuild and update cache
5. WHEN cache becomes stale THEN the system SHALL automatically invalidate and refresh

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for CI/CD pipeline health, so that issues can be detected and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on build times, success rates, and resource usage
2. WHEN pipeline failures occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications to relevant teams
3. WHEN deployment health checks fail THEN the system SHALL trigger immediate alerts
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL create performance reports
5. WHEN SLA thresholds are breached THEN the system SHALL escalate to on-call engineers

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want artifact management and release automation, so that deployments are traceable and reproducible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL create versioned artifacts with metadata
2. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL generate automated release notes
3. WHEN artifacts are deployed THEN the system SHALL track deployment history
4. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to previous artifacts
5. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails for all deployments

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with existing deployment scripts and infrastructure, so that the new workflow leverages current investments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use existing deployment scripts (deploy-modporter-ai.sh, canary-deployment.sh)
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use existing test infrastructure (run-comprehensive-tests.js)
3. WHEN validating deployments THEN the system SHALL use existing validation scripts (validate-deployment.js)
4. WHEN managing databases THEN the system SHALL use existing migration scripts
5. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing health check endpoints

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want compliance and audit capabilities, so that regulatory requirements are met and security posture is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL log all actions with timestamps and actors
2. WHEN security scans run THEN the system SHALL maintain historical scan results
3. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate automated compliance documentation
4. WHEN audit trails are requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete deployment history
5. WHEN security policies change THEN the system SHALL update scanning rules automatically
