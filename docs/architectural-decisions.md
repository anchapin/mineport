# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This document contains the architectural decision records for the Minecraft Mod Converter project. Each ADR documents a significant architectural decision, the context that led to it, the decision made, and the consequences.

## ADR-001: Modular Architecture with Pipeline Pattern

**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

The Minecraft Mod Converter needs to handle complex transformations from Java Edition mods to Bedrock Edition addons. The conversion process involves multiple distinct stages: ingestion, asset translation, configuration mapping, logic translation, and packaging.

### Decision

We will implement a modular architecture using the Pipeline pattern, where:

1. Each conversion stage is implemented as a separate module
2. Modules are orchestrated through a ConversionPipeline
3. Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces
4. Each module is responsible for a specific aspect of conversion

### Rationale

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific type of conversion
- **Testability**: Modules can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one conversion type don't affect others
- **Extensibility**: New conversion modules can be added easily
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent modules can process data in parallel

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Clear module boundaries and responsibilities
- Easy to add new conversion types
- Simplified testing and debugging
- Better code organization

**Negative**:
- Increased complexity in module coordination
- Need for robust error handling across module boundaries
- Potential performance overhead from module communication

**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive error collection and reporting
- Use efficient serialization for inter-module communication
- Provide clear module interface documentation

## ADR-002: Hybrid Translation Approach (AST + LLM)

**Date**: 2024-01-20
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team, Technical Lead

### Context

Java to JavaScript translation for Minecraft mods presents unique challenges:
- Direct API mappings exist for some functionality
