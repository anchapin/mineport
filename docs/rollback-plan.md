## Rollback Strategy

### Rollback Principles

1. **Safety First**: Always prioritize system stability over feature advancement
2. **Minimal Disruption**: Rollbacks should cause minimal impact to ongoing development
3. **Data Integrity**: Ensure no data loss during rollback operations
4. **Quick Recovery**: Enable rapid restoration of previous working state
5. **Clear Communication**: Keep all stakeholders informed during rollback events

### Rollback Levels

#### Level 1: Feature Flag Rollback
- **Scope**: Disable specific features while maintaining overall pipeline
- **Impact**: Minimal - affects only specific functionality
- **Duration**: < 5 minutes
- **Trigger**: Feature-specific issues

#### Level 2: Phase Rollback
- **Scope**: Rollback entire migration phase
- **Impact**: Moderate - reverts multiple features
- **Duration**: 5-15 minutes
- **Trigger**: Phase validation failures

#### Level 3: Complete Rollback
- **Scope**: Return to original basic CI workflow
- **Impact**: High - reverts all enhancements
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes
- **Trigger**: Critical system failures

#### Level 4: Emergency Rollback
- **Scope**: Immediate system restoration
- **Impact**: Critical - may cause temporary service disruption
- **Duration**: < 2 minutes
- **Trigger**: Production outages

## Rollback Triggers

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

#### Performance Triggers
- Build failure rate > 10% over 1 hour
- Average build time > 10 minutes for 3 consecutive builds
- Test failure rate > 5% over 30 minutes
- Deployment failure rate > 5% over 1 hour

#### Security Triggers
- Critical security vulnerability detected
- Secret exposure in code
- Security scan failure rate > 20%
- Unauthorized access attempts

#### System Health Triggers
- Service availability < 99% over 15 minutes
- Error rate > 5% over 10 minutes
- Response time > 2x baseline for 15 minutes
- Memory usage > 90% for 10 minutes

#### User Impact Triggers
- User-reported critical issues > 3 in 1 hour
- Support ticket volume increase > 200%
- Negative user feedback > 70% in 24 hours

### Manual Rollback Triggers

#### Business Triggers
- Stakeholder decision to halt migration
- Regulatory compliance issues
- Budget constraints
- Timeline pressures

#### Technical Triggers
- Unforeseen technical complications
- Integration failures with external systems
- Performance degradation not caught by automatic triggers
- Team capacity issues

## Automatic Rollback Procedures

### Trigger Detection System

The migration orchestrator continuously monitors system metrics and automatically initiates rollbacks when trigger conditions are met.

```javascript
// Example trigger configuration
const rollbackTriggers = {
  buildFailureRate: {
    threshold: 10, // percentage
    timeWindow: 60, // minutes
    action: 'rollback_phase'
  },
  criticalSecurity: {
    threshold: 1, // count
    timeWindow: 1, // minutes
    action: 'emergency_rollback'
  },
  deploymentFailure: {
    threshold: 5, // percentage
    timeWindow: 60, // minutes
    action: 'rollback_feature'
  }
};
```

### Automatic Rollback Execution

1. **Trigger Detection**
   ```bash
   # Monitor metrics
   ./scripts/migration-orchestrator.js monitor
   
   # Automatic trigger evaluation every 5 minutes
   # Immediate action on critical triggers
   ```

2. **Rollback Decision**
   ```bash
   # Evaluate rollback level based on trigger severity
   # Level 1-2: Feature/Phase rollback
   # Level 3-4: Complete/Emergency rollback
   ```

3. **Rollback Execution**
   ```bash
   # Execute appropriate rollback level
   ./scripts/migration-orchestrator.js rollback
   
   # Verify rollback success
   ./scripts/validate-rollback-success.sh
   ```

4. **Notification**
   ```bash
   # Send automatic notifications
   # Slack alerts for team
   # Email notifications for stakeholders
   # Status page updates
   ```

   ```bash
   # Backup current state
   ./scripts/backup-current-state.sh
   
   # Prepare rollback environment
   ./scripts/prepare-rollback-environment.sh
   
   # Notify team of impending rollback
   ./scripts/send-rollback-notification.sh "Manual rollback initiated"
   ```

3. **Execution Phase (5-15 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Execute rollback based on level
   
   # Level 1: Feature rollback
