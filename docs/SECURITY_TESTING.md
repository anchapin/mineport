# Security Testing Documentation

This document outlines the security testing approach for the Mineport project.

## ðŸ”’ Security Scanning Tools

### Free Security Tools Implemented

1. **npm audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanning
    - Scans package.json and package-lock.json for known vulnerabilities
    - Generates SARIF reports for GitHub Security tab integration
    - Runs automatically on every PR and push

2. **GitHub Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates
    - Weekly scans for outdated and vulnerable dependencies
    - Automatic security patch PRs
    - Grouped updates to reduce PR noise

3. **CodeQL** - Static code analysis
    - JavaScript/TypeScript security analysis
    - Detects potential security vulnerabilities in source code
    - Uploads results to GitHub Security tab

4. **GitLeaks** - Secret detection
    - Scans for accidentally committed secrets, API keys, tokens
    - Prevents secret exposure in version control
    - Blocks PRs containing detected secrets

5. **Trivy** - Container security scanning
    - Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities
    - OS package vulnerability detection
    - Integrates with GitHub Security tab

## ðŸ§ª Testing Procedures

### Manual Security Testing

```bash
# Run npm audit locally
npm audit

# Run npm audit with JSON output
npm audit --json > security-audit.json

# Check for high severity vulnerabilities only
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Fix automatically patchable vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
```

### Automated Security Testing

All security tests run automatically on:
- Pull requests
- Pushes to main/develop branches
- Daily scheduled scans (2 AM UTC)

### Security Report Generation

The security workflows generate comprehensive reports including:
- Vulnerability summaries
- Risk assessments
- Remediation recommendations
- Compliance status

## ðŸ“Š Security Metrics

We track the following security metrics:
- Number of vulnerabilities by severity
- Time to patch critical vulnerabilities
- Dependency update frequency
- Secret detection incidents

## ðŸš¨ Incident Response

1. **Critical vulnerabilities**: Address within 24 hours
2. **High vulnerabilities**: Address within 7 days
3. **Medium/Low vulnerabilities**: Address in next maintenance cycle

## ðŸ“‹ Security Checklist

- [ ] All dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] No secrets committed to version control
- [ ] Static code analysis passed
- [ ] Container images scanned (if applicable)
- [ ] Security tests automated in CI/CD
- [ ] Security documentation up to date

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Security

Our security approach includes:
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Regular dependency updates
- Security-focused code reviews
- Incident response procedures
- Security training and awareness
